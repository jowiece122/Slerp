Please click the "Hermite" checkbox for Hermite curves.
With Hermite mode on, please still use SHIFT+MOUSE LEFT to define NEW points.

Please click the "Define Tangent" check box to define tangent.
Number of tangent should equal to number of points, or an error will be printed.
With Define Tangent checked, please use SHIFT+MOUSE LEFT to define tangent.

With Hermite mode on, please still use CONTROL+MOUSE LEFT to drag all the points.

If you want to go back to original mode, restart the program might be a better idea than "Clear" button.

Thank you!
